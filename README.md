# ESP8266-Alarm-Clock

The purpose of this project was to drive your bedroom light via a relay controlled from an ESP8266.

The alarm doesn't use an RTC but continuously polls an NTP server which will need to be configured for your timezone.

There is alot of room for improvement so i'm hoping someone will take what's here and expand on it.
